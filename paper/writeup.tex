\section{The Building}

                                         
  The building was built in 1929, it was orginally  Synthetic fiber plant and was Closed in the 1970s. the building was not air conditioned until they got a hold of it. The plant tempeture has to be between 68 and 73 degrees.The parts are very susceptible to temptures because if the tempeture changes the tolerance will be diffrent and the company needs a part with a very consistant tolerance.Acutec has have to very good climate control. In the building they have signs everywhere with the acronym FOD. Which stands for Foreign object debris, it is also important aspect because they cannot allow ceratin things getting in to parts. The reason being is that it can cause damage to the part and in the case of airplanes it can kill people if something stops working.\cite{FOD}               
  
\section{The Parts}

Many of the parts that we saw have special coating that is only done in Texas and in Pennsylvania wich brings great differentiability. Since they are not a big company  like the automotive industry or the Iphone industry which make thousands parts in one day they have to take a diffrent approach to how they make there 70-140 parts a year.Many of the parts that are made are worth 200-300 because they don't really make that many parts they need to sell the decent priced parts. Every part has to treated to the highest quality. The parts go all around the world but not by Acutec. They sell their product a specific place and then they sell them international. only about 10\% is exported internationaly, but 40\% will be sold arround the world.  
Most of the parts are done with machine.When the part is not worked by a machine only the workers that have plenty of experince work.  

\section{The Workers}

The workers in Acutec have to come with a high skill because that is the only way to stay competive. It is not the case where a person out of high school can get job. They could accept them only if they have the ability to score a 5 or 6 on an exam. 
It really does not matter what the the educational level the worker has, the worker will get hired if they score high enough. it is usally harder for those with less education to score high. In the world that we live in today there is no more room for the guy with a hammer, everything in that company has gone digital. The Workers are important as the Machines. That is why they take the time too train their workers for 15 weeks, to get them ready for the job.
.One of the places where they spent a lot of money was in IT department. The former president did not say how much but through his tone of voice, it seemed like a huge amount.  

\section{Technology}

Acutec business has to be up to date with the latest technology to survive. Working with 3D printers Acutec believe that 3D printing is the future and they want to invest some time to figure out how it works. In the near future actually make parts with 3D printers. For now they just have models of the 3D parts. 3D printers maybe A slow process but having the ability to have multiple 3D printers. This process can actually save time and elminate workers giving them an advatange in the market.The advancement in the current machines have lowerd number of workers and made the parts faster to make, keeping up with the technology is very important to Acutec. Although technology is very important to company they also have to note that any other company can obtain acutec technology, so thing that has differentiate them has to be the workers.They need develope their workers so that they can out preform the competition. 

\section{WIP}

WIP stands for work in progress, it is your money just sitting there . Parts that were either sold or gonna be sold taking up space. The Parts cannot be exported because they have not been processed yet and therefore you want the WIP out of there as soon as possible because it just money ready to made. According the fromer VP if you ever own a business without a doubt we are going to run into WIP. Workers have to do a "FIFO" First In First Out so they have to get the first thing that came in and take it out first.   

\section{Side Notes}                  
Some of things That I noticed from walking arround is that everything was very clean. Most of the worker were operating machinery keeping busy. The Former VP talked to his worker like as if they were his friend, and had postive attitude. IT depratment were running their database on sql intergrated with a software Im not sure what . They had distributed system, maybe running on Puppet, but they had the ability to monitor all of there workers on multiple  screens.                       
                
\section{Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
 \item What are the sources of Acutec’s competitive advantage?
Acutec's workers are fully tested and ready to go for there work, they have lastest technology, and have a good reputation from quality work.  
 
 \item What are challenges does Acutec face with its rapid growth, especially with regard to the
international market?

Well, they want to move mexico but they are afraid that thier quality might go down. They fear that once they gain enough experince they will migrate to the US. They will get paid 3x if they were to stay here.

 \item What are government’s policies that affect Acutec recently?
 
 
 
 
 \item What roles does Acutec play in the local community?

Creates jobs to the local community, Acutec also is invoved with the comunity.   
 
 
\item Is Acutec environmental friendly? If Yes, how? If No, are there future plans for sustainable
development? 

Well if look at the case of the Plastic boxes we can say that reduced the use of cardboard boxes thus being enviromental friendly. Seems pretty sustianble to me you can keep the
